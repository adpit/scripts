tested with estroke 1.21.

1. install estroke and use it.

2. when 30-day evaluation time is over, estroke will refuse to start.
   uninstall it first.

3. double click reset-estroke.reg to delete estroke's reg keys/vals.

4. reinstall estroke. you can now use it again (for another 30 days).

without the *.reg file, estroke will still refuse to run after
reinstallation because it "remembers" (using the registry) that it had been
installed once.
